# Video Editing Script for Preprocessing in AI and Computer Vision Applications

This Python script leverages the moviepy library to perform essential preprocessing tasks on video files, which is a crucial step in AI and computer vision applications.

> Video Resizing: Adjusts the resolution of the input video to specified dimensions.
> Format Conversion: Converts the video format from AVI to MP4.
> Frame Rate Adjustment: Sets the frame rate of the output video to enhance performance in subsequent processing tasks.
>
> You can run the script with the command "python video_edit.py". The script reads an AVI video file (first_video.avi), resizes it to the desired pixel dimensions, converts it to MP4 format with the desired fps, and outputs the result as converted_video.mp4.
